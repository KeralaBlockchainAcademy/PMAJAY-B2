# Async Await Questions 


1. Write a JavaScript function that fetches data from an API and cancels the request if it takes longer than a specified time. 
2. Write a Node.js program that processes an array of numbers. The program should double each number in the array, but with a simulated delay of 1 second for each number using async and await. (easy)
3. Create an async function that reads a list of URLs from an array, fetches data from each URL, and logs the response times for each request. (Easy)
4. Implement a retry mechanism in an async function that fetches data from a URL. The function should retry up to 3 times before throwing an error.
5. Axios is an alternative to fetch. Find out the difference between them and rewrite the  program to get the data from real time API services using axios. (Easy)
6. Write an async function that fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. Then, filter the posts to only include those with userId equal to 1, and log the titles of these posts. (easy)
7. Implement an async function that makes multiple requests in parallel using an array of URLs. Once all requests are complete, find the request that took the longest time to complete and log its URL and duration.
